  I also created this fantastic character named Star Kid
  <head>

      <style>
          .GFG {
              width: 200px;
              height: 250px;
              margin-left: 400px;
              border-radius: 10%;
          }
          .GFG:hover {
              color: #111;
              background: transparent;
              box-shadow: 0 0 100px yellow;
          }
      </style>
  </head>

  <body>
      <div class="container">
          <img class="GFG" src=
  "starkid.png"/>
      </div>
    
  <script src="script.js"></script>
  
This character truly represents the power of the friendshiup. Star Kid really puts into persepcitve all of lifes challenges and how to overcome them. He is a very strong character and is a very good friend to have. Who knows, maybe he will be your friend too. para mis amigos de Queens, !yo soy tu amigo! (¬ødonde es woodside?)
